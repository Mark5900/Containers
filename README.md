# Containers
I tried to setup an dev environment for PowerShell it was easy when docker was installed.

But there is no place that describe, how to install PowerShell Modules, I did find a little when I Googled but their scenario was hard to understand so I created this Repo! ðŸ˜Š

All you has to do is copy the files from .devcontainer and change the Dockerfile to fit your scenario.
